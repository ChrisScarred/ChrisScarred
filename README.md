Hi, I’m @ChrisScarred (Chris "Scar(R)ed" Vajdík).

I am **an AI student**, **a web developer** and **a research engineer** solving current **NLP** problems. While building my projects, I pay a special attention to **security** and **user experience** since these aspects are often treated as an after-thought rather than being integrated with the principal ideas of every project.

Besides my qualifications, I outline my active support of marginalised societal groups. I am currently developing **a collaborative writing platform for Slovak and Czech writers** which will feature a safe, moderated discussion space to help dismiss the misinformation and stigma around subjects such as mental health and LGBT+ topics.
