Hello, I am **Chris 'Scar(R)ed' Vajd√≠k**, and my pronouns are **they/them**.

I am **an AI student** at Radboud University, **a volunteer web developer** and **an AI (research) engineer** specialising in **natural language processing**. While building my projects, I pay special attention to **security** and **user experience** and integrate these aspects with the principal components of every project.

I devote a significant amount of my time to supporting marginalised societal groups. I am the founder and a moderator of **Pastel Black**, a queer-friendly community of young CZ/SK collaborative writers, which features a safe, moderated discussion space to help dissipate the misinformation and stigma around subjects such as mental health and queer topics. I am building a web-based platform for the community and planning to launch **an online CZ/SK queer dictionary**.
